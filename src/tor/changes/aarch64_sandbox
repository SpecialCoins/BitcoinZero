  o Minor bugfixes (sandbox):
    - Fix sandbox support on AArch64 systems. More "*at" variants of syscalls
      are now supported. Signed 32 bit syscall parameters are checked more
      precisely, which should lead to lower likelihood of breakages with future
      compiler and libc releases. Fixes bug 40599; bugfix on 0.4.4.3-alpha.

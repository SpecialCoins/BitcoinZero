  o Minor bugfixes (dirauth):
    - Directory authorities stop voting a consensus "Measured" weight
      for relays with the Authority flag. Now these relays will be
      considered unmeasured, which should reserve their bandwidth
      for their dir auth role and minimize distractions from other
      roles. In place of the "Measured" weight, they now include a
      "MeasuredButAuthority" weight (not used by anything) so the
      bandwidth authority's opinion on this relay can be recorded for
      posterity. Lastly, remove the AuthDirDontVoteOnDirAuthBandwidth
      torrc option which never worked right. Fixes bugs 40698 and 40700;
      bugfix on 0.4.7.2-alpha.

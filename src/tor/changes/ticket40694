  o Major bugfixes (onion service):
    - Set a much higher circuit build timeout for opened client rendezvous
      circuit. Before this, tor would time them out very quickly leading to many
      unnecessary retries and thus more load on the network. Fixes bug 40694;
      bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha.

  o Major features (dirauth):
    - Directory authorities and relays now interact properly with
      directory authorities if they change addresses. In the past, they
      would continue to upload votes, signatures, descriptors, etc to
      the hard-coded address in the configuration. Now, if the directory
      authority is listed in the consensus at a different address, they
      will direct queries to this new address. Implements ticket 40705.

  o Minor features (directory authority):
    - Add a new consensus method in which the "published" times on router
      entries in a microdesc consensus are all set to a meaningless fixed
      date.  Doing this will make the download size for compressed microdesc
      consensus diffs much smaller.
      Part of ticket 40130; implements proposal 275.

  o Minor features (network documents):
    - Clients and relays no longer track the "published on" time declared
      for relays in any consensus documents.  When reporting this time on
      the control port, they instead report a fixed date in the future.
      Part of ticket 40130.

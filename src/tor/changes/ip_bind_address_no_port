  o Minor features (relays):
    - Set the Linux-specific IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT option on outgoing
      sockets, allowing relays using OutboundBindAddress to make more outgoing
      connections than ephemeral ports, as long as they are to separate
      destinations. Related to issue 40597; patch by Alex Xu (Hello71).

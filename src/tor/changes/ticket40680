  o Minor feature (relay, DoS):
    - Apply circuit creation anti-DoS defenses if the outbound circuit max cell
      queue size is reached too many times. This introduces two new consensus
      parameters to control the queue size limit and number of times allowed to
      go over that limit. Close ticket 40680.

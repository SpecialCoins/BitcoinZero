  o Minor feature (Mac and iOS build):
    - Change how combine_libs works on Darwin like platforms to
      make sure we don't include any `__.SYMDEF` and `__.SYMDEF SORTED`
      symbols on the archive before we repack and run ${RANLIB} on the
      archive. This fixes a build issue with recent Xcode versions on
      Mac Silicon and iOS. Closes ticket 40683.

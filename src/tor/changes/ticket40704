  o Minor feature (relay):
    - Two new consensus parameters are added to control the wait time in queue
      of the onionskins. One of them is the torrc MaxOnionQueueDelay options
      which supersedes the consensus parameter. Closes ticket 40704.
    - Change a hardcoded value for the maximum of per CPU tasks into a
      consensus parameter.

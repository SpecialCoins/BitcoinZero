  o Major bugfixes (OSX):
    - Fix coarse-time computation on Apple platforms (like Mac M1) where
      the Mach absolute time ticks do not correspond directly to
      nanoseconds.  Previously, we computed our shift value wrong, which
      led us to give incorrect timing results.
      Fixes bug 40684; bugfix on 0.3.3.1-alpha.
